A Familiar Place

After an exhausting day of walking, you decide to stop
for to rest. However, you can't shake the ever strong feeling
of deja vu. There's rolling, golden foothills, a path through
among the sycamores... Are you sure that you haven't been here
before? Suddenly, you remember that you had camped here before
and had hid a can of DELICIOUS BEANS (Trademark) in the bushes.
What do you do?
